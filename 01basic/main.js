// Is it neccessary to add camera to the scene?

// The camera does not need to be added to the scene for it to function. You can create a camera and use it to render the scene without adding it to the scene graph.

// Why Add It?: Adding the camera to the scene can be useful in certain situations:

// Hierarchical Transformations: If you want the camera to move with other objects, adding it to the scene allows you to group it with other objects and apply transformations collectively.
// Debugging and Visualization: It can be helpful for debugging purposes to see the cameraâ€™s position and orientation within the scene.
